# CodeIt - A Django-Based Web Forum Platform
## Eat. Sleep. Code. Repeat.

**CodeIt** isn’t just a forum — it’s a space where **ideas meet experience**, and **questions turn into knowledge**.
I built CodeIt to be a space for developers of all levels — from complete beginners to seasoned coders — to connect, help each other, and grow through discussion.

> **To make learning collaborative, fun, and accessible to everyone.**

Whether you’re starting your first line of code or contributing to open source — **CodeIt is for you**. Ask questions, share your journey, post what you’ve learned.
Because real growth happens when we **learn together**.
